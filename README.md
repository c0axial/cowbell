Cowbell
=======

Cowbell is an HTML / JavaScript audio player that can play diverse audio file formats with a common user interface, with a particular focus on the demoscene and tracker music


Features
--------

* Support for MP3, OGG (and whatever else your browser supports natively), MOD, XM, S3M, IT (and all other formats implemented by libopenmpt), PSG, VTX, STC and PT3 formats
* Modular design - new UI frontends can be built to work with all existing player formats, and vice versa
* Lazy loading - audio files (and heavyweight libraries such as libopenmmt) are only loaded at the point of pressing play


Building
--------

Requires CoffeeScript, Pasmo <http://pasmo.speccy.org>, Closure Compiler, Perl and Make. Run:

    make

from the root level.
